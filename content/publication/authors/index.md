abstract: While much research has been done on the gender wage gap, understanding the gender publishing gap as well as what makes best-selling authors unique is critical to understanding other disparities in the labor force. Our research examines the gender publishing gap among authors with a book on the New York Times Best Seller list (1931-2018) as well as among authors with a published work accepted into the United States Library of Congress (1900-2015). We study this labor market to understand what factors have contributed to womenâ€™s success.
